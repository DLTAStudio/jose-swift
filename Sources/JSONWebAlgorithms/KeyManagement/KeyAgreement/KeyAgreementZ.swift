    ///   - privateKey: A `JWK` instance representing the private key of the initiating party.
    ///   - publicKey: A `JWK` instance representing the public key of the responding party.
    ///   - ephemeralKey: An optional `JWK` instance representing an ephemeral key used in the agreement process.
    ///                  Ephemeral keys are temporary and typically used for a single session or transaction.
    ///   - sender: A Boolean value indicating whether the calling party is the sender or receiver in the key agreement process.

    /// - Returns: The computed shared secret as `Data`.
    /// - Throws: An error if the shared secret cannot be computed. This could be due to incompatible keys, incorrect formats, or cryptographic issues specific to the key agreement algorithm.
